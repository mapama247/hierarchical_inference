# Hierarchical Text Classification System

Python package that allows using a cascade of text classifiers based on a given hierarchy of language models.

## Setup
- Intall: `pip install .`
- Update: `pip install --upgrade .`
- Uninstall: `pip uninstall hierarchical_inference`
- Create source distribution and wheel: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
- Check build after compilation: `twine check dist/*`

## Usage
Toy example commands:
```python
from hierarchical_inference import Classification

clf = Classification()
res = clf.classify(taxonomy="ipc", text="This is a test")
clf.classify("fos", "This is another test")
```
Output:
```commandline
Running IPC classification at level 0... (model: intelcomp/ipc_level0)
Running IPC classification at level 1... (model: intelcomp/ipc_level1_G)
####### LEVEL 0:
                - Class: G
                - Full class name:  PHYSICS
                - Confidence score: 0.9405
####### LEVEL 1:
                - Class: 09
                - Full class name:  EDUCATING; CRYPTOGRAPHY; DISPLAY; ADVERTISING; SEALS
                - Confidence score: 0.3386


Running FOS classification at level 0... (model: intelcomp/fos_level0)
####### LEVEL 0:
                - Class: Medicine
                - Full class name:  None
                - Confidence score: 0.5535
{0: ('Medicine', None, 0.5535141229629517)}
```
As it can be seen, the `classify()` method returns a dictionary object with the taxonomy levels as keys, 
where the values are triplets that contain the classification output.

Additionally, the method `classify_batch()` can be used in a similar manner to perform classification by batches,
giving it a list of texts rather than a single string to classify. Type `help(clf.classify_batch)` for more details.

### Customizable attributes

After instantiating an object from the Classification class, you can access the following attributes:

- `WORKING_DIR`: Location where the package files are located. Change only if you want to read YAML files from somewhere else.
- `CACHE_DIR`: Path where models will be cached for faster inference in subsequent calls. Defaults to `~/.cache/huggingface/intelcomp`.
- `DEVICE`: Either "cuda" or "cpu", based on the availability of GPUs.
- `models`: Dictionary with the paths to the different models, hierarchically organized. 
- `classes`: Dictionary to map class codes to class names, hierarchically organized as well.
- `avail_taxonomies`: List of taxonomies available in `data/models.yaml`. Notice that this is a private attribute that 
cannot be directly edited by the user, although it can be updated after modifying the YAML files.

## Adding/Removing new taxonomies

To add and/or remove new taxonomies, the YAML files within the `data` directory must be updated accordingly.
It is important to always follow the original structure, which is showcased in the next section.

The Classification object will be initialized based on the YAML files content at creation time, but if such files are
modified afterwards, it is possible to update the taxonomy details by simply calling the `update_taxonomies()` method.

```python
from hierarchical_inference import Classification

clf = Classification()
print(clf.avail_taxonomies) # ['fos', 'ipc', 'nace2']
# YAML FILES BEING MODIFIED...
clf.update_taxonomies()
print(clf.avail_taxonomies) # ['fos', 'ipc', 'nace2', 'NEW_TAXONOMY']
```

## YAML files
The `data` directory contains 2 YAML files that can be edited by the user to add new taxonomies:
### `models.yaml`: 
Lists the models to be used for each taxonomy, with a different indentation for each of its levels. \
Can either contain the names of models from the HuggingFace Hub or paths to local repositories. \
The first level (i.e. 0) of any taxonomy only contains a single model, which would be the root node of the 
classification tree, while deeper levels have a list of models for each possible outcome from the prior level. 
This is why, for the non-zero levels, it is important to make sure that the model key (value preceding ":") 
matches some label from the previous model in the chain.
### `classes.yaml`: 
Lists the possible outputs of all classifiers from `models.yaml`, following the same format. \
It basically maps class codes to their corresponding names, for a better interpretability of the results.

**Note**: \
It is important to ensure that the class names (keys of inner dictionaries) are read as strings. \
The reason is that some taxonomies (e.g. IPC) have numeric codes that are preceded by a number zero (e.g. "01"). \
In these cases, YAML reads the key as an integer and, thus, the preceding zero gets lost.
The library makes sure to convert all keys to strings for consistency, but these specific cases with leading zeros 
are hard to handle since there is no way to tell if there was a zero or not in the original file. \
In order to prevent that, please make sure to surround this kind of numeric codes with double quotes.

### Examples
Below are the default YAML files, for reference. Notice how no quotation marks are required at all in `models.yaml`, 
since none of the taxonomies contains "problematic" codes and the function used to process YAML files already reads all
keys as strings.
